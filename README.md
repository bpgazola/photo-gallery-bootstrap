<h1>Photo gallery</h1>

Several times in frontend development, we were faced with the need to create a photo gallery for our projects.

A solution I developed was using the Bootstrap fremawork and its components. With the use of lightbox and jQuery it is possible to create a fully responsive photo gallery.

The version used to implement the solution is Bootstap 4.0.0, but you can use any version that uses the lightbox plugin.

The solution does not need to install any additional frameworks or plugins.
